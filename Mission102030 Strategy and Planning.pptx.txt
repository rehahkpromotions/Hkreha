Expanding Our Reach
Land Collaboration
We will explore partnerships with both private and public land owners to secure larger tracts of land for tree plantation. This will allow us to plant more trees either independently or in partnership with their team
Corporate Social Responsibility
We will engage with corporates to leverage their resources and expertise in supporting our mission. This could include financial contributions, employee engagement programs, and other initiatives.
Educational Engagement
We will involve students and staff from educational institutions in our tree planting efforts. This will include on-campus tree planting initiatives and environmental education programs.
Community Involvement
We will organize local tree planting events and workshops to promote sustainable practices within communities(rural and urban). This will raise awareness about the importance of tree plantation and encourage active participation.

Strategic Pillars: Guiding Our Approach
Budget Allocation
Allocate funds for saplings, land preparation, labor & materials, monitoring & maintenance, and data maintenance.
Sapling Availability
Plan sapling availability based on land type, ensuring diverse species and appropriate planting schedules.
Maintenance for 3 years
Tree plantation is a long-term commitment, and maintenance over the first few years is vital to ensure that the saplings establish themselves properly. This includes activities such as weeding, pest control, pruning, and monitoring tree health.
