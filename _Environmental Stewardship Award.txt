Introduction: At Hari Krishna Exports Pvt. Ltd. (HK), our commitment to sustainability is embedded in every facet of our operations, particularly in addressing the global challenge of water scarcity. The Mission River Initiative reflects our proactive approach toward environmental stewardship, with a specific focus on the Life Below Water category of the Environmental Stewardship Award. Through a series of targeted conservation and restoration efforts, we are aiming not only to revitalise the water ecosystems of Gujarat but also to set an example globally in sustainable water management practices.
The mission has been conceptualised to achieve water security and ecosystem restoration while involving communities, industries, and governments in a collaborative effort for long-term sustainability. With a set of defined and clear objectives, we seek to make tangible, lasting contributions to the health of water bodies and aquatic ecosystems, ensuring clean and accessible water for future generations.
1. Conserve 100 Billion Litres of Water: A Landmark Goal
One of the primary objectives of the Mission River Initiative is the conservation of 100 billion litres of water by utilising a blend of advanced and traditional water management techniques. This is a significant undertaking that involves careful planning and implementation of water-efficient systems to address both the growing demand for water and the increasing challenges posed by climate change. Several key strategies contribute to this conservation target:
* Rainwater Harvesting: Rainwater harvesting has been adopted as an essential practice for water conservation. This method involves capturing rainwater during the monsoon season to replenish groundwater levels and provide water for use during drier periods. By implementing this strategy on both community and industrial levels, we can drastically reduce reliance on natural water bodies such as rivers and lakes.
* Micro-Irrigation: With agriculture being the largest consumer of water, micro-irrigation technologies like drip irrigation and sprinkler systems ensure that water is applied directly to plants, minimising wastage and maximising crop yield. These techniques significantly reduce water consumption in farming, making it more efficient and sustainable.
* Watershed Management: The focus on watershed management ensures the protection and restoration of the natural catchment areas of rivers and lakes. This involves reforestation, soil conservation, and reducing the impact of human activities, which in turn improves water quality and prevents erosion, helping to preserve water bodies for future use.
Through the combination of these strategies, the Mission River Initiative aims to conserve 100 billion litres of water, ensuring that water is used efficiently, safeguarded, and replenished for generations to come.


2. Restore Aquatic Ecosystems and Biodiversity
The restoration of water bodies and aquatic ecosystems is at the heart of the Mission River Initiative. Healthy rivers, lakes, and wetlands play a crucial role in supporting biodiversity, regulating local climates, and providing clean water. Our goal is to restore 50 rivers in the next few years, enhancing the overall health of the ecosystem and improving the biodiversity in and around these water bodies.
1. Gagadiya River Rejuvenation Project
The Gagadiya River Rejuvenation Project is a flagship initiative designed to restore the health of the Gagadiya River by focusing on improving both its water quality and water availability. One of the cornerstones of the Mission River initiative is the Gagadiya River Rejuvenation Project, which was launched in 2017 with the ambitious goal of restoring the river’s health and capacity. The project covers an area of 52.9 km, and by 2023, 40 km of this river had already been restored, bringing a significant improvement to both water quality and the surrounding ecosystem.
Riverbed Restoration
Over time, rivers accumulate sediment, which can clog the riverbed and reduce the water's flow, creating stagnant conditions that promote pollution and disrupt natural habitats. As part of the rejuvenation process, riverbed restoration involves the following:
* Removing Sediment: Excess sediment can cause riverbeds to rise, affecting the river's natural flow. By removing these sediments, we can restore the natural depth of the river, ensuring better water flow and reducing the risk of flooding. This also helps in improving water quality by preventing stagnant conditions where pollutants can accumulate.
* Cleaning Polluted Riverbeds: Pollution from industrial, agricultural, and household waste often ends up in riverbeds. Cleaning these areas helps restore the natural environment, allowing the water to flow freely and increasing its capacity to support healthy aquatic life.
* Reintroducing Natural Habitats: Restoring the riverbed also involves ensuring that natural habitats are re-established for aquatic life, such as fish, amphibians, and various water plants. These habitats contribute to enhancing biodiversity and improving the overall health of the ecosystem.
Reforestation and Soil Conservation
The reforestation component of the project focuses on planting indigenous trees along the riverbanks. These trees help reduce the erosion of soil, which is a common problem in areas with riverbanks that are exposed to the forces of flowing water. The roots of these trees anchor the soil, preventing it from being washed away, which in turn preserves the river's natural course. Additionally:
* Prevents Silting: The vegetation along the river helps absorb rainwater and prevent soil runoff that might otherwise lead to silting in the riverbed, ensuring that the water flow is not hindered by excess material. This also reduces the sediment build-up in the river, keeping the water clear and improving overall water quality.
* Restores Ecological Balance: The planting of trees along the riverbanks helps to restore the ecological balance by providing habitats for wildlife. These trees play a role in water filtration, air purification, and regulating local temperature, which all contribute to the overall health of the ecosystem.
Enhanced Biodiversity
One of the most important goals of the Gagadiya River Rejuvenation Project is to revive aquatic life. Healthy rivers are teeming with life, from fish to amphibians, and are crucial for supporting both local and migratory species. By restoring the water quality, the project aims to:
* Support Fish Populations: Clean rivers with healthy, balanced ecosystems support fish populations that are essential for maintaining the food chain in the river. Additionally, fish populations themselves contribute to the ecological health of the water body by playing a role in nutrient cycling and keeping water clean.
* Encourage Waterfowl and Amphibians: Aquatic life isn’t just about fish. By ensuring that water bodies are clean and well-oxygenated, the project helps revitalise habitats for amphibians like frogs and waterfowl such as herons and ducks. These species benefit from healthy water bodies and play a significant role in controlling insect populations and supporting the aquatic food web.
 Additionally, our projects have contributed to the recharge of groundwater reserves, which have increased by 6–8.6 meters in regions surrounding the Gagadiya River.
2. Saraswati River Revival Project
The Saraswati River Revival Project is part of a larger effort to restore rivers that have dried up or degraded over time. The project aims to reintroduce the river's flow, ensuring it serves as a vital resource for local ecosystems and communities.
Riverbed Restoration (Similar to Gagadiya River)
This project involves a similar approach to riverbed restoration as the Gagadiya River project. By removing accumulated sediments and restoring the riverbed's natural structure, we aim to:
* Enhance Water Flow: Restoring the natural flow of water by reducing sediment build-up ensures that the river can sustain itself and provide water year-round, even in dry seasons. This also ensures that local communities and industries can rely on the river for agriculture and drinking water.
* Improve Water Quality: By clearing pollutants and sediment, the river can once again support a wide range of aquatic life. The restoration ensures clean water that benefits not only the flora and fauna but also people who depend on it for daily life.
Reforestation and Soil Conservation (Similar to Gagadiya River)
In the Saraswati River Revival Project, reforestation is an essential part of the restoration process.With a capacity of 941 million litres of water (measured during the 2017-18 period), Bharatmata Sarovar has transformed the local landscape. Planting trees along the riverbanks serves multiple purposes:
* Reduce Erosion: Trees help stabilise riverbanks, which are otherwise at risk of being eroded by the river’s natural flow, especially during heavy rains or floods.
* Prevent Silting: The trees slow down the flow of water and absorb water during rain, preventing soil from being washed away and deposited in the riverbed. This ensures that the river remains clear and maintains a steady flow.
* Create Natural Habitats: Reforestation provides habitat for a range of wildlife, including birds, mammals, and amphibians. These trees contribute to the overall ecosystem health by improving air and water quality and fostering biodiversity.
Enhanced Biodiversity
The Saraswati River Revival Project is particularly focused on restoring biodiversity by:
* Supporting Aquatic Species: Reintroducing life to the river allows fish, amphibians, and plants to thrive. These aquatic species help in maintaining the natural balance of the ecosystem, and some may even serve as food for other wildlife.
* Supporting Migratory Birds: Just like Gagadiya, the Saraswati River can become a haven for migratory birds. By ensuring the river is clean and restored, we make it an attractive stopover for birds on their migratory routes, offering them food, shelter, and a safe space to rest.


3. Bharatmata Sarovar: Transforming Barren Land into a Thriving Ecosystem
Bharatmata Sarovar is a prime example of how water bodies, when restored and properly managed, can contribute significantly to ecosystem health and biodiversity. What was once barren land has been transformed into a thriving water ecosystem that now supports a diverse range of flora and fauna.
Restoring Water Flow and Providing Habitat
By creating the Bharatmata Sarovar, we have effectively turned an arid area into a vital water body. This new lake provides a constant source of clean water throughout the year, even during dry seasons. It has become a critical habitat for both resident and migratory birds, including species like the Painted Storks and Herons. These birds migrate from distant places to rest, feed, and breed in the safe environment offered by the lake.
Creating Biodiversity Hotspots
* Indigenous Trees: Over 5,000 indigenous trees have been planted along the lake’s shores, providing vital nesting spots for birds, shade for aquatic life, and improved soil structure.
* Supporting Fish Populations: The lake’s steady water supply ensures a healthy environment for fish to thrive. This, in turn, supports the larger ecosystem of the lake, from herons feeding on fish to plants using nutrients from the water.
Contributing to Local Ecosystem Health
The establishment of Bharatmata Sarovar has helped restore the surrounding marine ecosystems and soil health. The water helps reduce the impact of soil erosion and promotes healthy vegetation growth around the lake. As a result, the local environment has seen increased soil fertility, better water retention, and a more balanced ecosystem that benefits both wildlife and local communities.
3.  The Role of Artificial Lakes in Water Conservation
Artificial lakes like Fuliba Sarovar, Govindkaka Sarovar, and Bharatmata Sarovar play a critical role in improving water availability during dry spells. These lakes store excess rainwater during the monsoon season and release it during the dry season. This strategic water storage helps mitigate the impact of water shortages and ensures that agricultural and industrial needs are met.
4. Improve Water Access and Availability for Agriculture, Industry, and Households
Our water conservation efforts are designed not just for ecological health but also to benefit local agriculture, industry, and households. Restoring rivers and lakes increases the availability of clean water, reducing reliance on groundwater and improving irrigation systems. Key outcomes include:
* Improved Water Availability for Agriculture: By restoring rivers and promoting micro-irrigation, farmers are able to access a more reliable water supply, boosting agricultural yields.
* Stable Water Supply for Households and Industries: The artificial lakes and restored rivers act as a stable water source, providing communities and industries with clean water throughout the year, even during dry seasons.

We believe that addressing water scarcity and restoring ecosystems requires collective action and long-term commitment from all sectors of society. The initiative has been successful because it brings together local communities, governmental organisations, environmental NGOs, and other stakeholders into one cohesive effort. In addition to partnerships with local governments and environmental organisations, HK has collaborated with Kotmasu and Tata, two industry leaders committed to corporate social responsibility and environmental stewardship. These partnerships significantly enhance the reach, resources, and expertise available for the Mission River initiative, making it a powerful and far-reaching endeavor
2. Engaging Local Governments
Our work is heavily aligned with the water management policies of local and state governments. Through strategic partnerships with government bodies, we ensure that our projects are in line with regional water policies. By working with local authorities, we are able to leverage available government support for water management, ensuring that the Mission River initiative is integrated into broader regional and national environmental strategies.
Government initiatives like the Jal Shakti Abhiyan, focusing on water conservation, and the National Water Policy, which advocates for integrated water resource management, are central to our efforts. Through these collaborations, we ensure that our initiatives do not function in isolation but rather contribute to a larger, coordinated water conservation effort at the state and national levels.
3. Direct Engagement with Communities
The Mission River initiative is deeply rooted in the communities it aims to serve. It is our belief that sustainable solutions can only be achieved when the people who are most affected by water scarcity are directly involved in the process. Therefore, community engagement is the bedrock of our efforts.
Through various community outreach programmes, we conduct workshops and training sessions designed to educate local residents about sustainable water practices. These sessions focus on practical methods such as rainwater harvesting, micro-irrigation, and watershed management that can be easily implemented in rural communities. By directly engaging with local people, we are empowering them to take ownership of their environment and their water resources.
4. Jal Utsav: Raising Awareness through Celebration
One of the most visible and impactful events that we have launched as part of the Mission River initiative is Jal Utsav, Gujarat's first carbon-neutral water festival. This unique event is a powerful platform for raising awareness about the importance of water conservation and the need to protect local water sources.
The festival brings together a diverse group of stakeholders—community members, industries, and government representatives—in a celebration of water. In the first year alone, over 20,000 participants attended Jal Utsav, and more than 30 workshops and seminars were held to educate citizens, businesses, and government bodies about sustainable water management practices. By creating a positive and engaging environment, Jal Utsav helps foster a shared sense of responsibility for water management, emphasising that protecting water sources is a task for everyone, from individuals to industries and government agencies.
5. Capacity Building: Empowering Local Stakeholders
In order to ensure that water conservation practices are sustained over the long term, we have prioritised capacity building within local communities. These training programmes cover a wide range of topics, including water-efficient farming techniques, sustainable water management, and the importance of watershed protection.
We believe that empowering local farmers with the knowledge and tools to implement water-efficient practices can significantly reduce water wastage and improve water security at the grassroots level. To date, over 500 community members have completed workshops on rainwater harvesting and drip irrigation systems, and 1,000 farmers have been trained in water-efficient agricultural practices. These workshops have resulted in a 10-15% increase in water-use efficiency in the communities where they have been implemented.
6. The Bharat Mata Sarovar Initiative: A Model for Community Involvement
At the heart of our Mission River initiative is the Bharat Mata Sarovar project, a flagship initiative that exemplifies the power of community engagement in water conservation efforts. This project is a significant part of the Dholakia Foundation, a philanthropic arm of HK efforts to rejuvenate and conserve water bodies across India.
The Bharat Mata Sarovar project focuses on restoring and conserving a large water body that was previously in a state of decline. By implementing advanced water management techniques, this initiative not only revitalises the water body but also provides local communities with a reliable and sustainable water source. As a result of this project, local water levels have increased by 25-30% on average, improving the water availability for both domestic use and agriculture. Furthermore, it enhances local biodiversity, providing a habitat for migratory birds and other wildlife, and serves as an example of how water bodies can be restored with the active participation of local residents.
Through this project, we have engaged community members in conservation efforts, encouraging them to protect and nurture the water body. In the first year of implementation, over 2,000 community members were actively involved in the restoration and maintenance activities.
7. Holistic Water Management through Community-Based Solutions
Sustainability in water conservation cannot be achieved without the active participation of local communities. Therefore, we have taken multiple steps to ensure that water conservation practices are not only implemented but also embraced by the communities. One of the main strategies is the promotion of community-based water management.
Through community-led initiatives like watershed management and rainwater harvesting, we provide local residents with the tools and knowledge needed to manage their own water resources. This participatory approach not only helps to conserve water but also builds local capacity and resilience to climate change. To date, over 50 villages have successfully implemented rainwater harvesting and watershed management systems, benefiting over 15,000 people.
8. Monitoring and Impact Assessment
A critical part of the Mission River initiative’s success is continuous monitoring and assessment. We rely on feedback from local communities to measure the effectiveness of our programmes and make necessary adjustments. Regular surveys, focus group discussions, and community meetings provide valuable insights into the impact of our projects on local water sources, agricultural productivity, and environmental health.
Our impact assessments show significant improvements in water access, with 85% of respondents reporting better access to water for domestic and agricultural use. Additionally, the environmental benefits of the initiative are evident, with many communities witnessing improved vegetation growth, increased biodiversity, and reduced soil erosion.
